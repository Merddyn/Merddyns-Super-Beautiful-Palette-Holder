# Merddyns-Super-Beautiful-Palette-Holder
Best used with a desktop color picker tool, this allows you to store and save colors in palettes for easy reference. Especially useful for making projects for clients, as you can just have an easy reference of the colors in their style guide 

Select "Add Palette" to create an xml file that stores the palette, or Import Palette to open an existing one (generally from another user, as you can have multiple open at a time). Then change the name in the text box, which will update on the left.

The biggest thing to be wary of is needing to press the save button after changes, as they will bot be saved otherwise. ... I should probably go back and add a confirmation box for switching palettes or exiting for exactly that issue.

For each individual color, the top text box is the name of the color (optional), under that is a panel displaying the color, and the second text box is where you enter the values for the color (or can copy them if you want). The copy button puts the currently displayed values text in the clipboard, and the dropdown menu changes what format the values text is displayed / copied / entered in.

Possible formats include: RGB (with and without the CSS rgb tag), hex (with or without preceding #, and in either RRGGBB or BBGGRR format, because apparently some of my girlfriend's art programs use BBGGRR.) or in HSV.

Made for my girlfriend in 2018 and named by her.
